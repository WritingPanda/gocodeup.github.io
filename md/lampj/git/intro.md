## Version Control

As you start to write code, you will begin to see a need to backup and save different versions of your code as you progress in a project. This process is called Version Control, and there are many tools available to help us track changes in our software.

Please start reading about version control here:

## Git and GitHub

Git is a version control tool that is very popular in the open source software community, and with software developers in general. In our LAMP+J course we will be using Git and you will need to become familiar with it.

GitHub is an online service that manages Git repositories. As a student of the LAMP+J class, you will need your own GitHub account. Work completed in the course will be "checked-in" to Git repositories in your account.

First, you will need to create a GitHub account. When creating your account, you may choose any username you'd like, but please use your real name and make sure to upload a recent headshot of yourself as your profile image. Once class starts, you will login to the Codeup learning system using your GitHub account and it is important that we can easily identify who you are.

## Coursework

Please complete the following 3 hour video course on Git essentials. Note: You can skip over lesson 2 since you already did the Git installation in the step above. Also, the GitHub for Mac client shown in the GUI section is what we will be using in the course so please download and install it during that lesson.
