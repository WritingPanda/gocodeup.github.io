## Virtual Environment Setup

In the Codeup LAMP+J class, we will be using a Virtual Machine (VM) running the LAMP stack. Please carefully follow the instructions below to setup your LAMP VM.


### Verify Dependencies

1) Open the Terminal App. Press &#8984;+SPACE, and then type: `Terminal` and hit RETURN.

2) Type `vagrant -v` into the Terminal window and press RETURN. You should see something like `Vagrant 1.4.3` print out. If instead, you see `command not found`, then Vagrant has not been installed properly. Use the link to Vagrant in the Software Install section to download and install Vagrant.

3) Type `virtualbox` into the Terminal window and press RETURN. The VirtualBox application should appear. If it does, close it by clicking the red X. If it doesn't and you receive `command not found`, then VirtualBox has not been installed properly. Use the link to VirtualBox in the Software Install section to download and install VirtualBox.

### Download Box File

Now that you have verified that the dependencies are installed properly, you need to download the Vagrant box file. Look in the pre-work email that you received from Codeup for the link to download this file. It is about 600mb in size. Download the box file to your `Downloads` directory.

### Download Codeup LAMP+J Vagrant Project

1) Download this file: [https://github.com/gocodeup/vagrant-lamp/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/gocodeup/vagrant-lamp/archive/master.zip), to your `Downloads` directory.

2) Open your `Downloads` directory in Finder and double click the zip file you just downloaded to extract it. It should be named `vagrant-lamp-master.zip`. You should now have a directory called `vagrant-lamp-master` in your `Downloads` directory.

### Import Box File and Create VM

When you reach this point, please verify you have a file called `quantal64.box`, and a folder called `vagrant-lamp-master`, in your `Downloads` directory. If you don't have both of these, please review the instructions above.

1) If your Terminal application isn't still open, re-open it.

2) In your Terminal, type: `cd ~/Downloads` and hit RETURN to change to your `Downloads` directory.

3) In your Terminal, type: `vagrant box add quantal64 quantal64.box` and hit ENTER. The command will run, and you should see a message that says: "Successfully added box 'quantal64' with provider 'virtualbox'!"

4) In your Terminal, type: `cd vagrant-lamp-master` to change to the directory you unzipped earlier.

5) In your Terminal, type: `vagrant up` to start creating your VM. First, you will see a message that says: "Bringing machine 'default' up with 'virtualbox' providerâ€¦". Within about 5 minutes, the process will complete and you will receive a message that says: "notice: Finished catalog run in XXX seconds".

6) To verify that your VM is running, browse to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should receive a Codeup success page.

7) Celebrate! You're done!
