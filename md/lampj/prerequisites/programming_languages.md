## How Does A Computer Understand A Programming Language?

Up to this point, we have learned the basics about how computers store data and make decisions, but how do computers know so many languages? Well, when it comes right down to it, the CPU (Central Processing Unit), often called the processor, holds the official language of the computer known as its instruction set. Surprisingly enough, there aren't all that many instructions. However, a combination of these core instructions, executed millions of times per second, can do some pretty amazing things.

Take a look at some of the x86 instruction sets here: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_instruction_listings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_instruction_listings)

Pretty cryptic stuff, right? You can actually write programs using the processors instruction set directly, but it isn't easy.
