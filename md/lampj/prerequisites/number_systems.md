## Decimal Number System

The number system we all use is called the decimal number system. The decimal system is also referred to as base 10. This makes perfect sense since the word decimal comes from the Latin word decimus, meaning tenth.

The question here is... mathematically, what does base 10 actually mean? Let's take a decimal number like `123` as an example. In the ones place there is a `3`, in the tens place there is a `2`, and in the hundreds place there is a `1`. The number `123` can actually be written in the following way:

```
3 * 10^0 + 2 * 10^1 + 1 * 10^2 = 123
```

This is probably a review, but understanding this will help you to more easily grasp the other number systems that are used in computing.

## Binary Number System

Computers don't use the decimal system to count, instead they use the binary number system. The word binary means composed of two parts. Think of a switch that is either off or on. A binary number can be either `0` or `1`, `off` or `on`.

We will use `1111011` as an example of a binary number. Believe it or not, in decimal, that number is equivalent to `123`. Since the binary system can only be one of two values, it is base 2. In the same way we broke down the decimal number `123` above, let's break down our example binary number.

```
1 * 2^0 + 1 * 2^1 + 0 * 2^2 + 1 * 2^3 + 1 * 2^4 + 1 * 2^5 + 1 * 2^6 = 123
```

Your understanding of binary is pretty important because all sorts of programming ideas depend on it. After all, your entire hard drive is filled with 0's and 1's. We will get into this more when we talk about bits and bytes.

## Hexadecimal Number System

Another common number system used in computing is the hexadecimal number system. Hexadecimal numbers are base 16 and are represented using the numbers `0-9` and the letters `A-F`.

## Take Action!

After completing the reading for this module, please perform the following exercises:

- Learn to count to 15 in binary (write it out!).
- Convert the number 321 from decimal to binary.
- Find out why the hexadecimal number system is used in computing.
- Convert the number 321 from decimal to hexadecimal.

It's true...

> There are 10 types of people in this world. Those who understand binary, and those who don't.
