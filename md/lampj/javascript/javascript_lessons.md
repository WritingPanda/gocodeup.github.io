## Plethora of JavaScript Frameworks

Today, it seems like there are more JavaScript frameworks than can be counted, and more and more appear each day. We are already learning jQuery so we can perform DOM manipulation and make AJAX requests. Another category of framework that is useful to know is a structural or organizational framework. Since modern web developers are writing more and more code on the client-side, more structure helps create better code.

The structural framework we will be using is called AngularJS and it is backed by Google. You don't need to do any online lessons for this just yet, but please read about it so you at least understand what it is.
