## Dynamic Websites with PHP and MySQL

PHP is a scripting language that allows you to create dynamic websites, and since it is the "P" in LAMP, it will be one of the main focuses of our LAMP+J class. MySQL is the "M" in LAMP, and is the database we will be using in our class. In order to be effective at using any database, you will need to understand Structured Query Language (SQL).
